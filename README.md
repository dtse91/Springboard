# Springboard Data Science Mini-Projects

### Data Wrangling
1. [SQL with Mode Analytics](https://modeanalytics.com/dtse/reports/f9c91d091a0b): In this case study, I role play as an analyst responsible for triaging product and business problems as they come up. In many cases, these problems surface through key metric dashboards that execs and managers check daily. One morning, I noticed a dip in user engagement and now I am responsible for determining what caused the dip and, if appropriate, recommending solutions for the problem. At the end, I recommended a further discussion with the product manager to look closely into the mobile U.S. users who recently experienced lower email click-through rates thus leading to lower user engagement.
2. [SQL with country club data](https://github.com/dtse91/Springboard/blob/master/Data%20Wrangling/1520094343_sql_project.sql): I am approached by the owners of a country club (fictitious) and asked to answer several business-related questions. The data is located in a MySQL database with three tables related to a fictitious country club: Facilities, Members and Bookings. I excercise a variety of SQL concepts like joins, aggregations, filters and subqueries to answer their business questions.
